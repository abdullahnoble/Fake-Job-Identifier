# Fraudulent-Job-Identifier
We are not untouched by the unemployment issues in our day to day lives that has left a huge number of individuals, especially our youth, unemployed, putting them into facing the impacts of economic crisis. Its sad to know that some scammers are trying to take advantage of the people's desperation and cheat innocent job seekers in various ways. I myself have faced a huge number of scams on one of the largest internship providing website, even though the site says that the employer's are verified, they often try to sell their unwanted wasteful courses in the name of internship. And, its very sad to see that the website that cliamed it would take strict action against the scammers, end up just deactivating the employer's profile, that gets reactivated after few days. In a way, the job seeker's data was shared for free to the scammer. Frustrated by this and motivated by the thought of doing something using Natural Language Processing, I have made a FAKE JOB ANALYZER that can filter out the fake jobs with 97% accuracy.
